# alt:V Brainfuck module

## What is this

Idk, you tell me.

## Does it work?

No.

## Is this an April Fools joke?

Maybe.

## How to run this

Compile it using the `build.bat`, you need CMake and some other shit installed.
Then put it into your server modules directory and you are done.

## What about Linux

Nah.

## Why is there no pre-built binary

Too lazy to make CI.

## Why Brainfuck

Why not.

## Can I access the alt:V API with this?

Lol fuck no.

## Did you write this?

No, I shamelessly stole the interpreter from [here](https://github.com/texus/Brainfuck-interpreter).

## How can I contribute

By not contributing at all.

## Does it run Hello World?

Surprisingly, yes.

## Why does it take so long to interpret a small file

Great things take time, that is why the interpreter is slow as fuck.

Uhhh, maybe. Fuck around and find out.

## Is JS, Lua and C# module now obsolete?

Definitely.

## Will Client JS be replaced with Client Brainfuck?

Yes.

## What is Brainfuck

You tell me.

## Why are you making such horrible modules

God has punished me with this existence and I will make him pay for it.

## Are more modules like this coming?

If I feel like ruining someones day again then yes.

## My resource doesn't run it throws error, what do I do????

lol that would stink me.

## Why are there so many questions in this README

I don't want anyone to ask any questions about this to me personally.

## Don't you have like hobbies or something

No.

## Stop doing this

Also no.

## Can this README be over now?

I will think about it.

## Stop now

What will you do if I don't?
